<h1>Maşuk Müzik</h1>

Maşuk Music is a music uploading and listening platform I developed as an assignment for music education. On Maşuk Music, you can upload the music you want to listen to, organize them into playlists, and enjoy music on your mobile phone, computer, or tablet — essentially any device that can connect to the internet and access the website.
